# Radar Station Simulation
# This module is used to generate radar signals to be used with David Israel's track-and-scan,
# described in M-1343
# The program expects to receive data in the form of one-word messages, which might contain
# either a range or an azimuth reading (i.e., polar coordinates)
# This module also emulates the 1950 version of the Light Gun
# The program was done before the 'new i/o system', so radar and light gun were both
# wired in through flip-flop registers
