Whirlwind</h1>
<p>g fedorkow, Mar 15, 2024</p>
<p>This note outlines resources for anyone wishing to learn about
software restoration of code for the Whirlwind computer, built at MIT in
1949, active there until 1959. The material starts with background
reading, then covers how to run the simulation, and from there, how to
learn to read and even write Whirlwind programs.</p>

class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Reading Material</h2>
<p>For a summary of the Whirlwind project, the book <em>Project
Whirlwind: The History of a Pioneer Computer</em> by Redmond and Smith
is a good starting point. This book primarily focuses on the travails of
the Whirlwind team in obtaining and maintaining funding in a fluid
post-war environment, as DoD priorities were making a rapid pivot from
World World-War-II <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> demobilization to the new Cold War
threat.</p>
<p>The work outlined in the document you’re now reading is more focused
on the technology of Whirlwind software and programming.<br />
A recent summary of the machine’s capabilities and the current
restoration project can be found in guy’s IEEE paper on WW.</p>

class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Examining a Simple WW
program</h2>
<p>A good way to learn a bit of how the instruction set actually works
is to examine existing code. Here are some examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>examine the Whirlwind doc R-196 (link below), with the bouncing ball
example on page 53. Note that this code (and document) was written very
early in the WW project, prior to the introduction of the redesigned I/O
system described in 2M-0277.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>examine Rainer’s Vector Clock. This is a time-of-day clock which
displays using the CRT and vector instructions. The program was written
from scratch by Guy &amp; Rainer in a slightly-more-modular style than
the WW programmers would have used (i.e., it’s not a historical artifact
in any way)</li>

<ul>
<li>install the simulator (see above)</li>
<li>read the Assembler notes (written, but not yet posted) (and there
are enough options and knobs on the simulator that it probably needs a
doc too)</li>
<li>Start simple, for example, revise the R-196 Bounce program for R
&gt; 1</li>
<li>Write Your Own Digital Clock (I’ll provide underlying time-keeping
in the sim)</li>

<ul>
<li><p>get a native assembler to work. (look for codes with “Basic

<li><p>Get Charles Adams’ thesis code working (“Intact Ship Stability”).
This is not likely to be easy – it was written as part of his thesis
project, but completed before there was enough functional Whirlwind to
actually run it, i.e., it’s 1,000 lines of very carefully reviewed but
untested code.</p></li>

<li id="fn1"><p>Most readers will think that WW-I happened during years
1914-1918, and WW-II was 1936-1942. In actual fact, WW-I (Whirlwind-I)
was first operational in 1949, and WW-II, while planned, was never
completed as such, but was re-oriented to the SAGE prototype XD-1 in
(1955?).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn2"><p>Whirlwind documents are all identified as with a couple
letters to identify the Series, then sequential numbers within the

Commonly used series are ‘M’ for Memos, ‘R’ for reports, ‘L’ for
administrative notes and meeting minutes, ‘DCL’ for Digital Computer
Lab. The system fractured a bit as Lincoln Labs grew, i.e., ‘2M’
probably indicates a memo from Lincoln Division Two.<a href="#fnref2"
