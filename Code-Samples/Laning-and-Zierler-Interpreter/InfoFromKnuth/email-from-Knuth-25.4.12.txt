    Hi Dag,

    Below is what I can find. Please pass it on to Guy etc., thanks. -- Don

    Dear Guy, I looked through my files, and fear that I didn't keep
    Laning's letter. What I did keep is this:
    1) a simple acknowledgment dated 13 July 1976 and sent to him at Draper Lab:
       Dear J. H.:
         Thanks so much for that wonderful collection of documents you
       sent, and the informative letter.
    2) a letter that I sent to Corbato, asking for help understanding
      Whirlwind machine language. I've just put it online, FYI:

           https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/to-Corbato-76-08-03.pdf

    (He didn't reply.)
    3) a letter that I sent to Laning, after going through the code:

           https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/to-Laning-76-08-16.pdf

    And I also found a much earlier letter from him where he told me about the
    actual early use of his program:

    I recall being especially impressed that his interpreter not only
    did the algebraic operations of a "normal" compiler, it also had a
    built-in Runge-Kutta numerical integration routine (if my memory
    is correct)! More precisely, it had special syntactic sugar for the
    system's Runge-Kutta routine. Certainly a novelty in language design.

    Laning's co-author, Neil Zierler [pronounced ZEE-ler], was a colleague
    of mine when I spent the year 1968-1969 at IDA in Princeton.
    I don't remember ever discussing this interpreter with Neil, however;
    and in those days I had no idea that I'd ever see the source code.

    In 1976 I wrote what I knew (and know) about that system, in my
    paper with Luis Trabb Pardo, presented at the 1976 computer history
    conference at Los Alamos, first published in Marcel Dekker's
    Encyclopedia of Computer Science of Technology 1977, and reprinted
    with corrections as Chapter 1 of my book Selected Papers on
    Computer Languages. The LZ system is discussed on pages 45--49.

    Hmm, rereading that, I now see that it refers to Laning's letter of 1976,
    quotes a few lines, ... and mentions that the letter was 11 pages long.

    Aha! I had been looking in the wrong place --- the missing letter
    was not in my correspondence files because it was the kind of letter
    that I kept in one of my "manuscript miscellany" files!

    So, as I'm writing this note to you, I'm simultaneously discovering
    that my correspondence with Laning is indeed part of 606 scanned pages
    from part 2 of that manuscript file! On June 18 I wrote a letter to him
    (now preserved as page 532); the two subsequent letters to him that
    were mentioned above were also preserved in that file; and ... ta-da ...
    pages 590 through 606 were his original 11-page letter and
    some of its attachments! Bingo.

    The bottom line is that there now are two more online files

           https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/to-Laning-76-06-18.pdf
           https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/from-Laning-76-07-02.pdf

    and I hope all of your questions are satisfactorily answered.

    Thanks for sending me to my squirreled-away archives tonight.
    This history certainly deserves to be preserved! -- Don
