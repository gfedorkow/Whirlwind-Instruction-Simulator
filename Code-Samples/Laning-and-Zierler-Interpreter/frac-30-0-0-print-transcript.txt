|       vx; pN, where N is the address in storage of the first register of the
|               interpretive subroutine (in title of main program)
|       vl: pO (does not need to be inserted) to print, p64 to punch, or pl28
|               to print and punch simultaneously
|       v2: pn, where n is the number of decimal digits to be printed.
|   
|   Description
|   
|       This subroutine prints and/or punches the sign and magnitude of the
|   contents of the MRA in the following manner
|   
|            +-.d1d2...dn
|   
|   The number, n, of decimal digits to be printed is a preset parameter (v2). The
|   digits, di, are obtained by multiplying the magnitude of the contents of the MRA
|   successively by p10.
|   
|   This subroutine contains a sign agreement program so that the contents
|   of the MRA need not be a number whose major and minor parts are of like sign.
|   
|   The sp instruction transferring control to this subroutine must be an
|   interpreted sp (i.e., control must be in the interpretive subroutine). After
|   execution of the subroutine control remains in the interpretive subroutine which
|   then proceeds to interpret the instruction following the sp instruction in
|   storage.
|   
|   There is no carriage return.
|   
|   This subroutine can be used with any(30,0,0) interpretive subroutine.
|   The contents of the MRA are left undisturbed during the execution of this
|   subroutine.

|   
|   Abstract: This subroutine prints out a +- sign and a decimal point followed
|             by the magnitude of the contents of the MRA as a decimal fraction.
|             The decimal digits are obtained by multiplying the contents of the
|             MRA successively by plO. The number of digits to be printed is
|             a preset parameter (v2). There is no carriage return. The sub-
|             routine is interpreted and can be used with any (30,0,0) inter-â€”
|             pretive subroutine.
