               ; LAS 4/13/25 This file is adapted from frac-30-0-0-print.ww, but
               ;    altered enough that we can't call it the same routine
               ;    anymore. One basic change is replacement of the qp instruction
               ;    with si/rc instructions for the flexowriter, and also replacement
               ;    of the code table with flex codes. It's not known yet what codes
               ;    were used by the device on the receiving end of the qp.  Since
               ;    we're essentially creating a new routine, much of the the doc
               ;    included with the orginal has been omitted from the description below.

               ; |   Description
               ; |
               ; |       This subroutine prints and/or punches the sign and magnitude of the
               ; |   contents of the MRA in the following manner
               ; |
               ; |            +-.d1d2...dn
               ; |
               ; |   The number, n, of decimal digits to be printed is a preset parameter (v2). The
               ; |   digits, di, are obtained by multiplying the magnitude of the contents of the MRA
               ; |   successively by p10.
               ; |
               ; |   This subroutine contains a sign agreement program so that the contents
               ; |   of the MRA need not be a number whose major and minor parts are of like sign.
               ; |
               ; |   The sp instruction transferring control to this subroutine must be an
               ; |   interpreted sp (i.e., control must be in the interpretive subroutine). After
               ; |   execution of the subroutine control remains in the interpretive subroutine which
               ; |   then proceeds to interpret the instruction following the sp instruction in
               ; |   storage.
               ; |
               ; |   There is no carriage return.
               ; |
               ; |   This subroutine can be used with any(30,0,0) interpretive subroutine.
               ; |   The contents of the MRA are left undisturbed during the execution of this
               ; |   subroutine.
               ; |
               ; |   Abstract: This subroutine prints out a +- sign and a decimal point followed
               ; |             by the magnitude of the contents of the MRA as a decimal fraction.
               ; |             The decimal digits are obtained by multiplying the contents of the
               ; |             MRA successively by plO. The number of digits to be printed is
               ; |             a preset parameter (v2). There is no carriage return. The sub-
               ; |             routine is interpreted and can be used with any (30,0,0) inter-â€”
               ; |             pretive subroutine.
