6.25 Demonstration Programs Using Special
Display
The recent installation of special display equipment
(see Sections 2.22 and 5.2 of this report) provided
an opportunity to try some programs intended
for use with test storage and the display scope,
such as the programs discussed in E-220. An important
convenience factor had to be considered,
namely that it is desirable to be able to alter the

Description
Puts the content of register No. 10, originally -1 + 2 5 , into AC
Adds the desired increment to the x in AC
Stores the new value of x in register No. 10 and displays x on the display scope
Multiplies x in AC by x from register No. 10, forming x2 in AC

Stores x in a dummy register and displays x on the display scope
Multiplies x in AC by x from register No. 10, forming x ' in AC
Stores r ina dummy register and displays T? on the display scope
Returns to the order in Register No. 1, thus repeating the cycle for a new value of x

completely by using the switches on the test-control
racks. By use of the switches which determine the
numbers to which the flip-flop storage registers
and the program counter are reset, a change can
be introduced without any interruption while the
computer is in operation, since the registers in
question are actually reset only by a pulse from
special display during the flyback time of the display
scope. The switches of toggle-switch storage
(since they, unlike the reset switches, actually pass
video pulses) are in the computer room and hence,
although readily accessible, are not "front panel"
controls.
With these factors in mind, two quite elementary
programs were written, each being quite short so
that both can be stored simultaneously in toggleswitch
storage, and either one selected at will by
changing the program counter reset switches (the
same scheme was used in the conversion program,
Section 6.24 above).
The first of these programs simply plots the
values of x, x , and y? for x between -1 and 1. In
this powers-of-x program, the values are plotted
for -1 + 2" 5 + nh, where n simply increases until
a value of x greater than 1 is reached and where
the value of the increment h can be chosen at will,
using the reset switches of a flip-flop register.
Photographs of the resultant curves are shown in
connection with Section 2.22 of this report. The
program used proceeds as follows (see Summary
Report 19 for explanation of code):

scope ends its sweep and starts the whole program
over again; thus by adjustment of the display

The second display program is designed to plot
the pairs of curves + Ax for - K x <1 andfor several
values of A in the range 1> A^ 0. The program
used is as follows; the registers used are in
practice chosen so that they will not conflict with the
powers-of-x program (the actual program is given
in E-300).
Description
Puts a value of A (initially from register No. 16)
into AC
Multiplies by x (initially -1 + 2"15) from register
No. 21
Multiplies again by x
Displays Ax2 and stores it in register No. 24
Puts -Ax2 into AC
Displays -Ax2 and stores it in register No. 24
Increases the content of register No. 1 by 2" (initially
changingfromca 16toca 17), thereby selecting
a new value of A
Subtracts ca 15 + n from the quantity ca 16 + n inAC
(where n i s the number of pairs of curves desired)
If the result is negative or 0, meaning that fewer
than n pairs have been plotted, control is returned
to register No. 1 to plot another pair
All the curves having been plotted for one value of
x, x is put into AC
h i s added to x, thereby giving a new value of x
The sum i s stored in register No. 21
The order ca 16 comes to AC from register No. 20
The order ca 16 is stored in register No. 1, thus preparing
to repeat the whole cycle for the new value of x
Control is returned to register No. 1 to repeat the
whole cycle
