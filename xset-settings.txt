There are actually 2 blankers going at the same time. One handled by xset s and the other handled by xset dpms. Both are set to default 600 seconds (10 min.)
To view current settings use:

Code: Select all

xset q

I find it easiest to turn one off and only deal with the one.

Code: Select all

xset s off

Then to set blanking to 30 min. for example:

Code: Select all

xset dpms 1800 1800 1800

Note that on reboot both screenblankers will revert to the default 600 seconds.
If you want to have your own settings each boot then add the 2 commands to autostart: viewtopic.php?f=66&t=294014
